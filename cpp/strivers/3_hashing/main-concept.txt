basic hashing ( not STL yet)
using indexes to get information --- somehow making find/search,insert etc as O(1) 
--- either by using larger array, linked list etc

--- watch video Hashing for more

CRACK:

Whenever you come across a problem, first thing you will get clicked is bruteforce..
--- think can you do hashing on it -- user defined or STL
--- most common hashing requirements are --- unique elements, number of time something appear, avoid loops

--- parallelly you should be thinking of doing it by array, vector, ll ?
---- also thing of tabular & recursion
--- then use of stack, queue, dequeue, etc ( tree and graph also in advanced)
--- finally apply DP to solve it at lesser time complexity and lesser space.

things to remember during strings hashing is ascii

a-z - 97 - 122 (+26)
A-Z - 65 - 91 (+26)
0-9 - 48 - 57 (+9)

if you dont remember 'f' - 'a'  this way you can use


------ division method as well try to learn -- simple, array of 10 can be used to store information of 100 elements
