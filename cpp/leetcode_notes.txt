//here i am trying to note down the problem and best solutions i used for them

#1   -> two sum                                 ----> hashing --> unordered_map
#2.  -> add 2 numbers                           ---> linkedlist
#3.  -> longest substring                       --> hashing --> unordred_set or array of intergers
#4   ->                                    SKIP --->-HARD
#5   -> Longest Palindromic Substring           --> recursion, substrings.
#6.  -> Zigzag Conversion                       --> vector string & some basic logic
#7   -> Reverse integer                         ---> basic logic, but check boundary condition of integer size.
#8   -> String to Integer (atoi)                ---> simple but tc of borderline, int_max & min. 
#9   -> Palindrome Number                       ---> very simple, but beware of loop, INT_MAX
#10  -> Regular Expression Matching        SKIP ---> looks easy but HARD, needs DP ( read a lot, revisit)
#11  -> Container With Most Water               ---> simple vector, but avoid double for loops, left right
#12  -> Integer to Roman                   SKIP --->  -- med but boring, read the logic. try it later
#13. -> Roman to Integer                   SKIP ---> -----easy try
#14  -> Longest Common Prefix              SKIP ---> understood the logic - try
#15  -> 3Sum                               SKIP ---> understood the logic, but try
#16  -> 3Sum Closest
#17
