// this is notes for strings

Strings in C programming
====================================================
- defined as character array - char str[] = "hello Roshan";
- fixed size like arrays- obviosly its an array.
- format specifier issue (%s), also not much functions
- to add 2 strings you cant use +, you have to use strcat(str1,str2);
- Google/chatGPT for more difference

Strings in C++
=====================================================
- improvised like vectors
- you can define as a string --- string s;
- no size limit, dynamic
- have lot of functions on it , 
- have to use string header - same like C
- can give a delimeter to read line of string with seperation etc.
